Summary 
This lab project goes through building a web server using the Express framework in Node.js.
It recreates the basic functionality of our lab 2 work, but expands on it with multiple routes, modular code structure, and deployment to my virtual machine.

What's included
Express setup and route handling
Modular routing using a routes folder
Pages for /about, /contact, /date, and more
Extension tasks: parameterised routes, chained handlers, and serving static files
Deployment to VM with GitHub integration
.gitignore configured to exclude node_modules

Live app
The deployed app is running on the Goldsmiths virtual machine
http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/usr/432
Routes are: /about, /contact, /date, /welcome/:name, /chain, and /file
